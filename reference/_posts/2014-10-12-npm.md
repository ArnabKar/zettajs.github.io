# Install Zetta with NPM

Zetta is listed as a dependency in your `package.json` file. Running the `npm install` command from your project folder will retrieve all the packages specified in `package.json` and install them on your BeagleBone. At this point you will be installing Zetta itself.

Drivers in Zetta are distributed through the Node Package Manager - NPM. We'll be building a driver from scratch later in this project, but for now let's just pull this one off the shelf. In the Cloud9 IDE on yor BeagleBone, run this command:

The driver you just downloaded represents a piezo buzzer in software. It's a state machine that is comprised of the `on`, `off` states. When `on` it will turn the buzzer on, and when `off` it will turn the buzzer off. The changes in state are represented by transitions. Transitions are functions in Zetta that are called when the state of an object changes. Our piezo element has `on`, `off`, and `beep` as transitions. `on` and `off` change to their corresponding states, and `beep` will swap the state from `off` to `on` and back again.

> **DID YOU KNOW?**
> Every module you'll use in this tutorial is open source. This one can be found here https://github.com/zettajs/zetta-buzzer-bonescript-driver.

### What is This Code Doing?

* `var zetta = require('zetta');` requires the Zetta package. It contains all the functionality needed to configure an IoT app.
* `var Buzzer = require('zetta-buzz...` The second line requires the driver for the piezo element.
* `zetta()` initializes an instance of zetta for use in your code.
* `.use()` tells zetta that we want to use a piezo element hooked up to our BeagleBone Black.
* `.listen()` tells zetta that we want our API server to listen at port `1337`, and includes an optional callback.


  * {TIMESTAMP} will be the time the log was generated
  * {SOME-GUID} will be a 32 digit globally uniqe id.

## The Buzzer's API

In Zetta every device gets an API automatically generated for it. Our API represents the device in it's current state and the actions that can be taken on it. We use a special hypermedia type known as [Siren](http://sirenspec.org/) to represent devices and servers. You can see a response from your API now by clicking on "buzzer" in the Zetta browser.

This view has lots of extra details about our Pieze Buzzer, including it's full API response. Scroll down in the Zetta browser to see the API request & response that generated this very detail page.

## What Just Happened?!

We just got Zetta up and running! We installed a device in software, physically connected it, and controlled it's behavior with the Zetta browser - which uses the API Zetta constructed for us. Not too shabby for 4 terminal commands and 5 lines of javascript. The Internet of Things is bending to your will already.


Next up is our microphone sensor. This will detect the sound of possible intruders, and serve as another characterisitic that we can use to trigger our alarm. In this section connect another device, and learn how to view it's streaming data in the Zetta browser.

### What is This Code Doing?

We added two lines to our `server.js` file.

```javascript
var Microphone = require('zetta-microphone-bonescript-driver');
```

This includes the driver we just installed so that it's available to Zetta.

```javascript
.use(Microphone, 'P9_36')
```
This instructs Zetta to use the `Microphone` driver, and to look for a device that uses that driver on pin `P9_36`.


## What Just Happened?!

We connected another device to our growing security system. This one, a microphone, produces streaming data. This causes us to see a different type of visualization in the Zetta browser, and changes its API to reference a websocket monitor.


# Step #4: Write the Security App

In this section you'll learn about creating an app in Zetta. You'll also learn about streaming sensor data values, and taking advantage of those readings in your Zetta app. No new hardware in this section - we're going to write code that creates an interaction between the existing Microphone and Piezo Buzzer hardware that we setup in the previous two sections.

1. Write the export statement for the app to keep it modular.

   ```javascript
   module.exports = function(server) {
     //app goes here
   }
   ```

1. Write our first query. Zetta uses queries to look for devices, or wait for devices to come online that fill all the parameters given. Our first query tells Zetta to retrieve the buzzer for us, the second one retrieves the Microphone sensor.

```javascript
module.exports = function(server) {
  var buzzerQuery = server.where({type: 'buzzer'});
  var microphoneQuery = server.where({type: 'microphone'});

}
```

4 - The `server` variable is an instance of Zetta. We can use functionality attached to it to search for devices. We can use the method `server.observe()` to waits for devices that fit queries given in the first argument to come online, and then fire a callback.

  * We want the callback function to fire when `"buzzer"` and `"microphone"` devices come online.
  * The function passes in the state machines of the devices in as individual arguments.

```javascript
module.exports = function(server) {
  var buzzerQuery = server.where({type: 'buzzer'});
  var microphoneQuery = server.where({type: 'microphone'});

  server.observe([buzzerQuery, microphoneQuery], function(buzzer, microphone){
    //do something with the devices after we find them

  });
}
```

5 - Now we can work with our buzzer and microphone inside the `observe()` callback. Our microphone's driver defines it as having streams with volume. We'll listen for a `"data"` event to happen on a `"volume"` *stream*. Once we get that data, we want to test to see if value is above `10`. If it is, call the `"turn-on"` transition on the buzzer.

When we're all done, this is what our `app.js` file should look like:


Line 5 includes our app. Because it's built like other node modules (remember `module.exports`?), we just have this single additional `require`. This includes our app like a library and makes it available to use later.


Line 10, the third `.use()` function can determine what type of module you pass into it, and is smart enough to know wheter you're passing it a device driver or an app.


You must both `require` your `app.js` file, and `use()` it in order for Zetta to execute it at runtime.


## Make it Beep! (Again!)

Just like before, pressing the `beep` in the Zetta browser button will cause your piezo buzzer to make sound. Click on the `microphone` device to show the detail view, and make a loud noise (like a clap), or just tap on the top of the microphone. Whenever you see a spike in the graph, you should also hear the piezo buzzer sound.

## What Just Happened?!

We wrote an app to coordinate actions between devices connected to Zetta. The app used Zetta queries to find devices registered to our node, and `server.observe()` to guarantee the devices were available before trying to run logic that included them.

Specifically, we told Zetta to watch the volume `stream` of our microphone, and to trigger `turn-on-pulse` for the piezzo device when the microphone's volume goes above `20`.
