# Install Zetta with NPM

Zetta is listed as a dependency in your `package.json` file. Running the `npm install` command from your project folder will retrieve all the packages specified in `package.json` and install them on your BeagleBone. At this point you will be installing Zetta itself.

Drivers in Zetta are distributed through the Node Package Manager - NPM. We'll be building a driver from scratch later in this project, but for now let's just pull this one off the shelf. In the Cloud9 IDE on yor BeagleBone, run this command:

The driver you just downloaded represents a piezo buzzer in software. It's a state machine that is comprised of the `on`, `off` states. When `on` it will turn the buzzer on, and when `off` it will turn the buzzer off. The changes in state are represented by transitions. Transitions are functions in Zetta that are called when the state of an object changes. Our piezo element has `on`, `off`, and `beep` as transitions. `on` and `off` change to their corresponding states, and `beep` will swap the state from `off` to `on` and back again.

> Every module you'll use in this tutorial is open source. This one can be found here https://github.com/zettajs/zetta-buzzer-bonescript-driver.

### What is This Code Doing?

* `var zetta = require('zetta');` requires the Zetta package. It contains all the functionality needed to configure an IoT app.
* `var Buzzer = require('zetta-buzz...` The second line requires the driver for the piezo element.
* `zetta()` initializes an instance of zetta for use in your code.
* `.use()` tells zetta that we want to use a piezo element hooked up to our BeagleBone Black.
* `.listen()` tells zetta that we want our API server to listen at port `1337`, and includes an optional callback.


  * {TIMESTAMP} will be the time the log was generated
  * {SOME-GUID} will be a 32 digit globally uniqe id.

## The Buzzer's API

In Zetta every device gets an API automatically generated for it. Our API represents the device in it's current state and the actions that can be taken on it. We use a special hypermedia type known as [Siren](http://sirenspec.org/) to represent devices and servers. You can see a response from your API now by clicking on "buzzer" in the Zetta browser.

This view has lots of extra details about our Pieze Buzzer, including it's full API response. Scroll down in the Zetta browser to see the API request & response that generated this very detail page.

## What Just Happened?!

We just got Zetta up and running! We installed a device in software, physically connected it, and controlled it's behavior with the Zetta browser - which uses the API Zetta constructed for us. Not too shabby for 4 terminal commands and 5 lines of javascript. The Internet of Things is bending to your will already.


Next up is our microphone sensor. This will detect the sound of possible intruders, and serve as another characterisitic that we can use to trigger our alarm. In this section connect another device, and learn how to view it's streaming data in the Zetta browser.

### What is This Code Doing?

We added two lines to our `server.js` file.

```javascript
var Microphone = require('zetta-microphone-bonescript-driver');
```

This includes the driver we just installed so that it's available to Zetta.

```javascript
.use(Microphone, 'P9_36')
```
This instructs Zetta to use the `Microphone` driver, and to look for a device that uses that driver on pin `P9_36`.


## What Just Happened?!

We connected another device to our growing security system. This one, a microphone, produces streaming data. This causes us to see a different type of visualization in the Zetta browser, and changes its API to reference a websocket monitor.


# Step #4: Write the Security App

In this section you'll learn about creating an app in Zetta. You'll also learn about streaming sensor data values, and taking advantage of those readings in your Zetta app. No new hardware in this section - we're going to write code that creates an interaction between the existing Microphone and Piezo Buzzer hardware that we setup in the previous two sections.
