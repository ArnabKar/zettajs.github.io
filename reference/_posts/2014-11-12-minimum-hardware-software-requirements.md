# Overview

Zetta is a [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)-based platform and therefore runs on the same hardware and operating systems.

# Operating Systems

## Suggested Operating Systems

Common node.js [operating systems](http://nodejs.org/download/):

* Linux
  * 32-bit
  * 64-bit
* Windows
  * 32-bit
  * 64-bit
* Mac OS X
  * Universal
  * 32-bit
  * 64-bit
* SunOS

# Hardware

As you plan for your target hardware platform keep in mind the suggested minimums below assume Zetta will be running with a few connected devices per hub. As the number of devices, types of data and load of each device increases so will the minimum hardware requirements.

Zetta runs well on a 500MHz CPU. 500mb of RAM is the ideal minimum. Storage of 1 to 2 GB is optimal depending on how small the operating system is. Zetta requires only 500 MB to run.

## Minimum Hardware Requirements

* CPU: 500 Mhz
* Memory: 500 MB
* Storage: 500 MB of free space
