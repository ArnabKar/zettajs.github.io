Zetta's IoT workshops provide participants a rich, hands-on experience with the latest IoT hardware and software so that they can interconnect [geo-distributed devices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), build [sensor networks](http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/labs/bwn/actors/) and stream [video](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media) and [data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) to the cloud and mobile apps.

Participants run their code in the cloud and on IoT hardware platforms like [Intel Edison](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html) and [Texas Instruments BeagleBone](http://www.ti.com/tool/beaglebk?DCMP=PPC_Google_TI&k_clickid=3a482c21-c619-1449-a25f-0000454eb959). Workshop projects and demos will interoperate with a range of device protocols including [Bluetooth Low Energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy), [ZigBee](http://www.zigbee.org/) and [Z-Wave](http://www.z-wave.com/).

Workshop participants will create a network of sensors and actuators using off-the-shelf physical components, open source software and open source hardware.

The workshop duration is from one to four hours. It is designed for twelve students and is taught by two engineers.
