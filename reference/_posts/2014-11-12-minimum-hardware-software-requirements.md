# Overview

Zetta is a [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)-based platform and therefore runs on the same hardware and operating systems as node.js.

# Hardware

As you plan for your Zetta hardware platform, please keep in mind the suggested minimums assume Zetta running with around six connected devices per hub. As the number of devices, types of data and load of each device increases so will the minimum hardware requirements.

Zetta runs well on a 500MHz CPU. 500mb of RAM is the ideal minimum. Storage of 1 to 2 GB is optimal depending on the size of the operating system. Zetta requires only 500 MB to run.
