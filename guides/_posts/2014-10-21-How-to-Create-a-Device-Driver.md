# Step #1: 

## Clone the Starter Code

1. Clone [the Zetta starter device](https://github.com/zettajs/zetta-starter-device-driver) to a new directory called `zetta-{my-device}-{my-platform}-driver`.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zettajs/zetta-starter-device-driver zetta-{my-device}-{my-platform}-driver
   ```

   > **info**{:.icon} `{my-device}` is the name of the device and `{my-platform}` is the name of the target platform for the device driver. For example, `zetta-led-arduino-driver` is a LED driver for the Arduino and `zetta-buzzer-bonescript-driver` is a buzzer driver for the BeagleBone using Bonescript.
